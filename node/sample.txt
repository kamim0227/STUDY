Though the spring rain might be the same,
I do not belong to this concrete building.
Though a poet should not, 
may I write an easy poem?
With the money made with blood and sweat, 
I go to listen to the old lecturers. 
While my friends are leaving one by one, 
to what end am I going down so deeply and deeply?
An easy-written poem is shameful, 
as the life is not.
Though the spring rain might be the same,
I do not belong to this concrete building.
